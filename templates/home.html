        <p>
            Osteoarthritis is a very common condition which can affect any joint in the body. Itâ€™s most likely to affect the joints that bear most of our weight, such as the knees and feet. 
            Joints that we use a lot in everyday life, such as the joints of the hand, are also commonly affected.
